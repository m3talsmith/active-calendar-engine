h1. ActiveCalendar Introduction

ActiveCalendar is designed to treat calendars in the same manner that ActiveRecord treats normal records. This is designed first and foremost to be used with Google Calendar.

*This project is brand new and unusable right now. I will remove this when it's ready for some sort of use in the very near future. At that point I'll also update this with examples and so on.*

h2. Credits

Here is a list of people that I have either borrowed from or used as inspiration for this project:

* "zoriorz":mailto:zoriorz@gmail.com and his "gcalapi":http://rubyforge.org/projects/gcalapi/ project.
* "francisoud":http://github.com/francisoud and his "Googlecalendar":http://github.com/francisoud/googlecalendar project. This is the project that sparked me in to acting on ActiveCalendar.
* "maiha":http://github.com/maiha for the simple idea of making helpers for views to easily tap in to this kind of functionality with his "tdiary":http://github.com/maiha/tdiary_google_calendar_plugin/ project.
